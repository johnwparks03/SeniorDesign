## Project Topic Area

-RTL-Level Secure Coding against Hardware Attacks. This project will focus on developing new static methods to detect hardware vulnerabilities in RTL designs written in Verilog, SystemVerilog, or VHDL. The goal of this project aims to enhance the security of hardware design early during the design stage.
