1. As a hardware design engineer, I want to check my design for insecure coding patterns so that I can prevent vulnerabilities early in the design process.
2. As a hardware verification engineer, I want to validate hardware designs are free of potential vulnerabilities so I can ensure hardware designs meet security requirements.
3. As a hardware manufacturer, I want to ensure my hardware products are free from vulnerabilities before they are purchased.
